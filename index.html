    <h3>India Accelerates Its Push Towards Artificial Intelligence</h3>
    <p>
        India is rapidly positioning itself as a global leader in Artificial Intelligence.
        With government-backed AI missions and startup ecosystems expanding across major
        cities, the country is investing heavily in research, infrastructure, and skill
        development. Universities are introducing AI-focused degree programs, and
        private companies are building advanced AI-driven platforms.
    </p>
    <p>
        Experts believe that AI will significantly transform governance, healthcare,
        agriculture, and education sectors. From smart crop monitoring systems to
        predictive healthcare diagnostics, AI adoption is reshaping India's innovation
        landscape. Analysts predict that this movement could contribute billions to
        the national economy in the coming decade.

    <h3>Global Power Shifts and the Changing World Order</h3>

    <h3>Climate Change Intensifies Extreme Weather Events</h3>
    <p>
        Climate change is increasingly contributing to extreme weather events across
        South Asia and other vulnerable regions. Heatwaves, floods, and unpredictable
        rainfall patterns are affecting agriculture, infrastructure, and livelihoods.
    </p>
    <p>
        Environmental scientists emphasize the need for urgent policy reforms,
        renewable energy adoption, and climate resilience planning. Governments and
        global organizations are working together to reduce carbon emissions and
        promote sustainable environmental practices to safeguard future generations.
